###Getting Started:


In `src/Components/Auth.js` replace the `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET` variable values with your application's credentials.

**OR**

If you would like to create a .env with your application credentials: create the .env in the react_example folder outside of src. Name your variables REACT_APP_API_KEY and REACT_APP_SECRET_KEY and your .env should populate the keys within the example app for you.

###To Run:

cd into src

Use the following commands:

`npm install`

`npm start`
